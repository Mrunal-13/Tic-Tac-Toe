## Introduction

This project is all about creating a tic tac toe using python.it is intresting to use functions in python for this project.

To explore more and learn it all you need is knowledge of programming language python then the next story is all below ..

## Language and enviornment

Language : **Python**
 You can have installed python IDE in your computer.
 You can also have jupyter notebook from anaconda navigator.
 Set up your enviornment and start coding.
 
 ## What is the game?

   P1 and P2 will get alternate chances.
   each one have to choose one notation X or O. The first chance to choose their id will be given on basis of random number appears.
   case 1: if P1 gets chance first to choose and he chooses X then p2 will be O.
   This viceversa occurs.
   
   P1 and P2 will have chance to put X and O in desired box alternatively.
   if any one player got winning condition before other gets then he will be the winner.
